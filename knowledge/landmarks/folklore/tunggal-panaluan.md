# Tunggal Panaluan (Sacred Magic Staff)

## Core Knowledge
The Tunggal Panaluan is the sacred magic staff of Batak shamans (datu), considered the most powerful ritual object in Batak spiritual tradition. The staff is carved from a single piece of wood and features stacked human figures, each representing ancestral spirits that guide the datu's magic.

According to legend, the first Tunggal Panaluan was planted by Si Raja Batak, the mythical ancestor of all Batak people, when he descended from Pusuk Buhit mountain. The staff is said to channel ancestral wisdom and protect the community from misfortune.

The carving process itself was sacred - only initiated datu could create them, often requiring months of ritual preparation including fasting and offerings. The figures on the staff represent a hierarchy of spiritual power, from village guardian spirits to cosmic forces.

Today, original Tunggal Panaluan are preserved in museums like Huta Bolon, while replicas are sold as souvenirs. The staff remains a powerful symbol of Batak spiritual heritage.
