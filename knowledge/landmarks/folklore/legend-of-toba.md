# Legend of Toba

## Core Knowledge
The Legend of Toba is the origin story of Lake Toba and the Batak people, passed down through generations of oral tradition. While versions vary, the core narrative remains consistent:

A young fisherman named Toba caught a magical golden fish in the river. When he brought it home, the fish transformed into a beautiful woman named Nai Bulan (Moon Princess). She agreed to marry him on one condition: he must never reveal her fish origins to anyone.

They lived happily and had a son named Samosir. One day, young Samosir was tasked with bringing lunch to his father in the fields. Being hungry, the boy ate the food himself. Enraged, Toba struck his son and shouted, "You son of a fish!"

This broke the sacred promise. Nai Bulan and Samosir fled to the mountains as the sky darkened. A great flood emerged from the earth, filling the valley to create Lake Toba. The island in the center, formed from the risen earth, was named Samosir after the son.
