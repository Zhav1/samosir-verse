# Sigale-gale

## Core Knowledge
The Sigale-gale is a life-sized wooden puppet originating from Tomok village, Samosir Island. According to Batak tradition, it was first created by Raja Rahat of the Sidabutar clan after his only son died. Grief-stricken and with no heir to perform funeral rites, the king commissioned master carvers to create a wooden effigy of his son.

The puppet is operated by concealed ropes and levers, making it appear to "dance" during performances. In traditional funerals (especially for those who died childless), the Sigale-gale would move to the rhythm of Gondang drums, its arms swaying and head nodding - believed to house the spirit (tondi) of the deceased temporarily.

Today, Sigale-gale performances are demonstrated for cultural preservation, though the original sacred funeral context has largely faded. The craftsmanship represents the pinnacle of Batak woodworking, with each puppet taking months to carve.
