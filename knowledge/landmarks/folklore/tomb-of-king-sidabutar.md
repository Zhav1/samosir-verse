# Tomb of King Sidabutar

## Core Knowledge
The Tomb of King Sidabutar is an ancient stone sarcophagus complex in Tomok village, Samosir Island. It serves as the final resting place for generations of the Sidabutar royal clan, one of the most powerful marga (clan) in Batak Toba history.

The main sarcophagus, dating back approximately 500 years, is carved from a single massive stone and features the distinctive Singa (mythical lion-like creature) head - a symbol of power and protection in Batak culture. The Singa motif, with its bulging eyes and gaping mouth, was believed to ward off evil spirits from the deceased.

King Sidabutar himself is legendary in Batak history for establishing Tomok as a major trading and spiritual center. The tomb complex includes several sarcophagi for his descendants, arranged in a sacred pattern. Visitors still leave offerings (flowers, coins, cigarettes) to honor the royal spirits.

Traditional Batak burial practices reserved stone sarcophagi for nobility and important figures. Common people were buried in wooden coffins or cliff-side caves.
