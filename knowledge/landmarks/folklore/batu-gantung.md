# Batu Gantung (Hanging Rock)

## Core Knowledge
Batu Gantung is a massive rock formation that appears to defy gravity, suspended on a cliff face overlooking Lake Toba. Located near Parapat (visible from Samosir), this geological marvel is wrapped in Batak legend.

According to oral tradition, a beautiful maiden named Seruni fell in love with a man her father disapproved of. When her father arranged her marriage to another, she fled to this cliff. Rather than submit to an unwanted marriage, she threw herself from the cliff - but the gods, moved by her devotion, turned her to stone mid-fall, suspending her between heaven and earth for eternity.

Geologically, the formation is the result of volcanic activity and erosion from the ancient Toba supervolcano eruption 74,000 years ago. The contrast between scientific explanation and spiritual legend exemplifies the Batak worldview where nature and spirit are intertwined.
