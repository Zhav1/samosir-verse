# Ombus-Ombus

## Core Knowledge
Ombus-Ombus is a traditional Batak sweet cake - steamed rice flour filled with palm sugar (gula aren), wrapped in banana leaves. The name comes from "ombus" meaning "to blow" in Batak - referring to the puffing motion of chewing the soft, slightly chewy texture.

Unlike many Southeast Asian sweets that are intensely sugary, Ombus-Ombus offers a subtle sweetness balanced by the grassy, slightly smoky notes of banana leaf. The rice flour exterior is soft and slightly sticky, while the palm sugar center melts into a caramel-like filling when warm.

This humble cake represents Batak home cooking at its most comforting. Grandmothers (opung) traditionally made it for grandchildren as an after-school snack or treat during harvest time. The simple ingredients - rice flour, palm sugar, coconut - were always available in village households.

The banana leaf wrapper serves multiple purposes: natural non-stick surface, flavor infusion, and eco-friendly packaging. Each piece is individually wrapped, making it perfect for portable snacking.
