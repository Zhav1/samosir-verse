# Arsik

## Core Knowledge
Arsik is the quintessential celebratory dish of Batak Toba cuisine - spiced carp (Ikan Mas / goldfish) cooked in a rich, golden sauce of andaliman pepper, torch ginger, and turmeric. No Batak wedding, funeral, or major ceremony is complete without this dish.

The preparation is distinctive: the whole fish (often kept intact for presentation) is simmered in a sauce base of ground shallots, garlic, ginger, turmeric, and the star ingredient - andaliman. The cooking is slow, allowing the sauce to reduce and coat the fish with deep, complex flavors.

Andaliman (Zanthoxylum acanthopodium), sometimes called "Batak pepper," is crucial. Unlike regular pepper, it produces a tingling, numbing sensation similar to Sichuan peppercorn, but with citrusy overtones unique to the Lake Toba region. This ingredient cannot be substituted - it's what makes Arsik distinctly Batak.

In Dalihan Na Tolu customs, presenting Arsik has symbolic meaning. The fish head is offered to honored guests or elders (hula-hula position), while other parts go to different kinship roles.

## Key Facts
- Main ingredient: Ikan Mas (carp/goldfish)
- Key spice: Andaliman (Batak pepper) - irreplaceable
- Other ingredients: Torch ginger, turmeric, shallots, kaffir lime
- Cooking: Slow-simmered, sauce reduced
- Context: Major ceremonies - weddings, funerals, blessings
- Presentation: Often whole fish, head to honored guest

## Cultural Context
- "Party food" - never everyday meal
- Fish head placement = kinship hierarchy
- Andaliman only grows in Toba region
- Modern versions may use different fish (less authentic)
- Part of "sipapanganon" (ceremonial foods)

## Common Misconceptions
- NEVER from Sulawesi - Arsik is strictly Batak Toba
- "Goldfish" means carp, not ornamental fish
- Cannot use black pepper instead of andaliman
- Not supposed to be spicy-hot, but tingly-numbing
