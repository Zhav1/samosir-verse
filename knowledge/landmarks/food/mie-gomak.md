# Mie Gomak

## Core Knowledge
Mie Gomak is a thick, hand-pulled noodle dish that has become a beloved comfort food across Batak lands. The name refers to the "gomak" (curly, bouncy) texture of the handmade noodles - distinctly thicker and chewier than manufactured noodles.

The dish features thick wheat-flour noodles (about the width of udon) served in a savory broth seasoned with andaliman pepper, garlic, and shallots. Toppings typically include shredded chicken, boiled egg, fried shallots, and fresh scallions. The andaliman provides the characteristic tingling sensation that marks it as distinctly Batak.

Mie Gomak represents the adaptation of Chinese noodle traditions to Batak taste preferences. The Toba highlands, with cool morning temperatures, made warm noodle soup particularly appealing. Local cooks added indigenous spices like andaliman to create something unique.

The dish is especially popular for breakfast, when the warm broth and substantial noodles provide energy for the day. Street vendors and small warungs across Samosir serve their own variations.
