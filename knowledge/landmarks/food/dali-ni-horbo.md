# Dali Ni Horbo

## Core Knowledge
Dali Ni Horbo is traditional Batak buffalo cheese - one of the very few indigenous cheese varieties in Indonesian cuisine. The name translates directly as "buffalo milk curd" (dali = curd, horbo = buffalo). This fermented dairy product has been made in the Batak highlands for centuries.

Unlike European hard cheeses, Dali Ni Horbo is soft and fresh, similar to ricotta or fresh mozzarella. The production involves curdling fresh buffalo milk with a natural acid (often papaya sap or vinegar), then draining and lightly pressing the curds. The result is a mild, creamy cheese with faint tangy notes.

The cheese reflects the importance of water buffalo (horbo) in Batak culture. These animals served as status symbols, sacrificial animals for major ceremonies, and daily sources of milk. Making Dali Ni Horbo was a way to preserve precious milk before spoilage.

Today, genuine Dali Ni Horbo is increasingly rare as water buffalo numbers have declined. However, some Samosir villages continue the tradition, particularly around Ambarita and traditional markets.
