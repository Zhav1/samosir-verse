# Naniura

## Core Knowledge
Naniura is raw carp "cooked" through citrus acid - the Batak equivalent of ceviche or kinilaw. Fresh carp is sliced thin and marinated in a mixture of lime juice, torch ginger, andaliman pepper, shallots, and chili. The citric acid denatures the proteins, transforming raw fish into a tangy, refreshing delicacy.

The dish originated as a practical preservation method before refrigeration. Fishermen could prepare their catch immediately using readily available ingredients, ensuring freshness even on long trips. The high acidity also prevented bacterial growth.

Naniura is distinguished from Arsik by being served completely uncooked (no heat applied). The fish should be extremely fresh - ideally caught the same day. The marinade time is typically 30 minutes to 2 hours, just enough for the lime to "set" the fish while maintaining tender texture.

While less ceremonial than Arsik, Naniura is a beloved everyday dish and reflects Batak ingenuity in food preservation. It's particularly popular during hot afternoons when a cooling, tangy dish is most refreshing.
