# Binangalom Waterfall

## Core Knowledge
Binangalom Waterfall (Air Terjun Binangalom) is a hidden cascade tucked into the forested interior of Samosir Island. The waterfall feeds into a crystal-clear pool perfect for swimming, surrounded by lush tropical vegetation. The secluded location has helped preserve its pristine character.

"Binangalom" relates to the sound of rushing water in the local dialect. The falls are not particularly tall (approximately 15-20 meters) but compensate with steady flow and the beautiful natural pool at the base. The water originates from highland springs, making it remarkably cold and clean.

Local belief holds that bathing in Binangalom's waters brings good fortune and health. This adds a spiritual dimension to what is also simply a refreshing natural swimming hole. Visitors sometimes leave small offerings at the falls' base.

Access requires a short jungle trek, typically 15-30 minutes from the nearest road. The path passes through village land and forest, offering glimpses of traditional agriculture and native wildlife.
