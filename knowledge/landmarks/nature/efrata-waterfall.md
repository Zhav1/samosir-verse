# Efrata Waterfall

## Core Knowledge
Efrata Waterfall is the most dramatic cascade on Samosir Island, plunging approximately 70 meters through multiple tiers of rock into rainforest below. The waterfall's name comes from the biblical "Ephrata" (Bethlehem), reflecting Christian influence in naming natural landmarks after missionary activity in the region.

The multi-tiered structure creates a spectacular visual effect - water cascading from pool to pool, each tier creating smaller falls and mist clouds. On sunny afternoons, rainbows form in the spray, adding to the site's photogenic appeal.

Access to Efrata requires a longer trek than other Samosir waterfalls - approximately 1-2 hours through forest paths. The trail can be muddy and steep, requiring proper footwear. The effort is rewarded with dramatic views at multiple levels of the falls.

The surrounding forest is remarkably intact, hosting diverse birdlife and plant species. The waterfall feeds a stream system that eventually drains to Lake Toba, connecting this highland ecosystem to the greater lake basin.
