# Pusuk Buhit

## Core Knowledge
Pusuk Buhit is a sacred mountain rising on the western edge of Samosir Island, revered as the birthplace of the Batak people. According to Batak cosmology, Si Raja Batak - the mythical ancestor of all Batak - first descended from the upper world to this mountaintop before populating the lands around Lake Toba.

Standing at approximately 1,972 meters, Pusuk Buhit dominates the Samosir skyline. The mountain's name translates roughly to "navel peak" (pusuk = navel, peak; buhit = sacred), reflecting its status as the spiritual center of Batak origin.

Pilgrims still climb Pusuk Buhit for spiritual purification and to connect with ancestral roots. The trek is challenging, typically taking 3-5 hours, passing through forest and eventually reaching stone formations believed to mark Si Raja Batak's first footsteps.

For adherents of Parmalim (traditional Batak religion, predating Christian conversion), Pusuk Buhit remains an active site of worship. Even Christian Batak often acknowledge the mountain's ancestral significance while reframing the legends in biblical context.
