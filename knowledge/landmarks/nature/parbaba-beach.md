# Parbaba Beach

## Core Knowledge

Parbaba Beach is a stretch of sandy shore on the northeastern coast of Samosir Island, offering what many consider the most accessible and family-friendly beach experience on Lake Toba. Unlike the infinite oceans of coastal Indonesia, Parbaba provides the gentler, freshwater embrace of the lake - warm and clean, with views of the caldera rim rising across the water.

## Opung's Memory

*"When I was young, no one 'went to the beach.' We went to the lake to fish, to wash, to collect water. The idea of going to sit on sand and splash in water for fun? That was something we saw outsiders from the cities do.*

*Now my grandchildren pester me: 'Opung, take us to Parbaba! Opung, we want to swim!' And I take them, and I watch them run into the water screaming, and I think: this is what peace looks like.*

*I sit in the shade because my old skin has had enough sun. I watch the children. I watch the families - Batak families like mine, but also Javanese, Chinese-Indonesian, Europeans with their very white skin. All in the same water. The lake does not care who you are. Everyone floats the same.*

*Once, a little boy from Jakarta swam up to my granddaughter. They did not speak the same language well - he was pure Indonesian, she speaks Batak Toba at home. But they splashed water at each other and laughed. They played for an hour. When his family left, they waved goodbye like old friends.*

*The beach is not sacred. It gives no lessons in history or tradition. But it teaches something else: how to be happy in the present. How to share water with strangers. How to be a child, even when you are old. Perhaps that is a lesson too.*"
