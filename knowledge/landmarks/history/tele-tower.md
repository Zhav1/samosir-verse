# Tele Tower (Menara Tele)

## Core Knowledge
The Tele Tower is a colonial-era viewing platform perched on the caldera rim overlooking Lake Toba and Samosir Island. Built by the Dutch colonial administration, it originally served as a telecommunication relay point before becoming a panoramic viewpoint for visitors.

The tower stands at approximately 1,500 meters above sea level, offering one of the most dramatic vistas of Lake Toba - the largest volcanic lake in the world. From this height, visitors can see the full expanse of the caldera, the island of Samosir, and on clear days, the mountains of the Sumatran highlands.

The name "Tele" is likely derived from "telegraph" or "telephone" - reflecting its original communication function. During the Dutch East Indies period, such relay stations were essential for maintaining colonial administration across the archipelago's difficult terrain.

Today the simple tower structure remains, joined by modern viewing platforms and small cafes. The site is particularly popular for sunrise viewing, when mist rises from the lake surface and golden light illuminates the caldera walls.
