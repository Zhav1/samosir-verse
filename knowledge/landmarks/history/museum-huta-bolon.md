# Museum Huta Bolon Simanindo

## Core Knowledge
Museum Huta Bolon is an open-air museum in Simanindo village that preserves and showcases the living heritage of Batak Toba culture. The museum complex includes original rumah bolon (traditional longhouses) from the Sidauruk clan, along with collections of textiles, carvings, musical instruments, and ritual objects.

"Huta Bolon" means "big village" or "chief's village," referring to the elaborate multi-tiered traditional houses that were homes to clan leaders. These houses feature the distinctive saddle-shaped roof with carved hornbill decorations (singa) at the apex - symbols of cosmic balance between upper and lower worlds.

The museum serves dual functions: preservation and performance. Daily Tor-Tor dance demonstrations with live Gondang music allow visitors to experience Batak performing arts. The houses themselves are exhibit spaces containing centuries-old artifacts - ulos textiles, ancestral carvings, agricultural tools, and household items.

The Sidauruk clan, original owners of the complex, established the museum in the 1970s to preserve their heritage as modernization threatened traditional ways. Today it remains family-operated, with clan members serving as guides and performers.
