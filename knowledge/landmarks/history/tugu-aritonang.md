## Opung's Memory

*"I am not Aritonang. My marga is different. But I have attended gatherings at their monument, as they have attended ours. The marga system makes us all connected, you see. Your wife's people, your mother's people, your daughter's husband's people - the web spreads wide.*

*I remember once watching a man from Jakarta at the Aritonang monument. He was perhaps fifty, well-dressed, clearly educated. He had never been there before - his parents had moved to the city, and he had grown up far from the village.*

*He stood before the inscriptions for a very long time. His finger traced the names carved in stone. When he found his grandfather's name - there, in the genealogy - he wept. Not silently. Openly, like a child. His wife stood beside him, patting his back.*

*I understood. He had carried his marga name his whole life without really knowing what it meant. And suddenly, there it was: proof that he was not just a name, but a link in a chain stretching back centuries. His grandfather was real, and his grandfather's grandfather before him.*

*That is what the monuments are for. Not for tourists. Not for history books. For grandchildren who lost their way and need to find it again. The stone says: you belong here. These are your people. You are not alone.*"
