# Stone Chairs (Batu Parsidangan)

## Core Knowledge
The Stone Chairs of Ambarita are ancient carved stone seats arranged in a council circle, where Batak village elders (raja and parbaringin) gathered to deliberate on community matters and judge criminals. Dating back approximately 300-400 years, this site represents the traditional Batak legal and governance system.

The main complex consists of three distinct areas: the throne of the king (raja), the council seats for elders, and the execution stone. When serious crimes were committed - theft, adultery, or betrayal - the accused was brought before this council. After deliberation, punishment was decided collectively. For capital offenses, the condemned was led to the nearby execution stone (batu parhopuk).

The stone furniture was not randomly placed but follows the Dalihan Na Tolu arrangement - the three-pillar kinship system. Different kinship groups sat in specific positions, ensuring balanced representation in all judgments.

Today, Ambarita preserves this site as a living museum. Traditional houses (rumah bolon) still stand nearby, and local guides often demonstrate the seating arrangement and judicial process.
