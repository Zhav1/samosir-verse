# Stone Chairs (Batu Parsidangan)

## Core Knowledge

The Stone Chairs of Ambarita are ancient carved stone seats arranged in a ceremonial council circle, where Batak village elders and kings gathered to deliberate justice, resolve disputes, and - in extreme cases - carry out executions. Dating back approximately 300-400 years, this site represents the pre-colonial Batak legal and governance system in physical form.

### The Complex Layout

The stone furniture is arranged with specific purpose:

**The King's Throne (Batu Parsangkean)**
- The largest and most elaborately carved seat
- Positioned at the head of the arrangement
- Only the raja (king) would sit here
- Slightly elevated from other seats

**The Elder Seats**
- Arranged in a rough semicircle facing the throne
- Each seat for a village elder or clan representative
- Positioning reflected kinship hierarchy (Dalihan Na Tolu)
- Stone backrests for extended deliberations

**The Table Stone**
- A flat stone platform in the center
- Used for placing evidence, offerings, or documents
- Functioned as the "court table"

**The Execution Stone (Batu Parhopuk)**
- Located nearby but separate from the council area
- Where condemned criminals met their fate
- Often a flat stone with channels (for blood drainage)
- Today pointed out by guides but not dwelt upon

### The Judicial Process

Traditional Batak justice operated through:

**Accusation**
- Crimes reported to village leadership
- Serious cases warranted council convening
- The accused brought before the stone chairs

**Deliberation**
- Elders heard testimony from all parties
- Evidence examined
- Discussion could continue for hours or days
- Decision-making was collective, though the raja held final authority

**Categories of Crime**
- Theft: usually punishable by restitution, sometimes beating
- Adultery: complex, often involving bride price adjustments
- Treason/betrayal of clan: the most serious, potentially capital

**Punishment**
- Fines and restitution (most common)
- Physical punishment (beating)
- Banishment from the community
- Death (for the most severe offenses)

### The Cannibalism Question

Early European accounts often sensationalized Batak practices:

**Colonial Narrative**
- Dutch and German visitors emphasized cannibalism
- Served to justify "civilizing" colonization
- Many accounts exaggerated or fabricated

**Scholarly Understanding**
- Ritual consumption of enemies did exist in limited circumstances
- Was rare, specific to certain crimes (treason, enemy combatants)
- Not practiced casually or as general custom
- Ended before extensive European contact

**Modern Context**
- Tourist guides may mention it briefly
- Most Batak people find the emphasis frustrating
- The stone chairs represented justice, not bloodlust
- Colonial lens distorted understanding

### Dalihan Na Tolu in Governance

The stone chair arrangement encoded the kinship system:

**Hula-hula Position**
- Wife-giving clan representatives
- Highest ceremonial respect
- Seated in honored positions

**Boru Position**
- Wife-receiving clan representatives
- Important but lower in hierarchy
- Balanced by numbers

**Dongan Tubu Position**
- Same-clan representatives
- Peer relationships
- Mediating role

Justice required all three pillars present and balanced. A decision made without proper Dalihan Na Tolu representation was invalid.

### Preservation and Tourism

Today the Stone Chairs are:

**Protected Heritage**
- Official cultural heritage site
- Entrance fees charged
- Guides available to explain

**Living Connection**
- Siallagan clan descendants maintain the site
- Some ceremonial use continues
- Not merely a museum

**Tourist Experience**
- Visitors walk through the arrangement
- May sit on some stones (with permission)
- Photo opportunities
- Connected to nearby Huta Siallagan

## Opung's Memory

*"When I was young and foolish, I committed a wrong against another clan. A small matter - I damaged their canoe by accident and did not confess immediately. But the community knew. Eventually, I was called before the village council.*

*Not here, at Ambarita - my village was elsewhere. But we had our own stone chairs, simpler than these. I stood before the elders while they sat in their places. My father sat among them, his face closed like a door. He could not defend me; that would be improper. The elders of the wronged clan spoke against me. I had to stand and listen.*

*The decision: I would pay for the canoe's repair and provide three days of labor to the wronged family. And I would apologize publicly, which was the worst. A young man's pride, you know.*

*But here is what I remember most: after the judgment, the elder of the wronged clan stood up and clasped my hand. 'It is finished,' he said. 'We are not enemies.' The matter was closed. No lingering resentment. The stones had witnessed, the community had decided, and now we moved forward.*

*That is what people do not understand about this place. They see execution stones and think: bloodthirsty. But we also had restoration. We had closure. We had elders who cared for the community's peace, not just punishment. Justice is not only what you do to the criminal. Justice is how you heal the wound.*"

## Sensory Details

**Sight**: Gray volcanic stone worn smooth by centuries of sitting. Moss in the crevices. The semicircle arrangement creating a natural amphitheater. The execution stone, stained darker.

**Sound**: Wind through nearby trees. Birds. The guide's voice echoing slightly in the clearing. Tourists' footsteps on stone.

**Smell**: Green growing things. The mineral smell of old stone. Incense if offerings have been made.

**Touch**: The cool, pitted surface of ancient stone. The weight of history pressing down. The worn edges where countless hands have touched.
