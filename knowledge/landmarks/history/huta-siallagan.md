# Huta Siallagan

## Core Knowledge
Huta Siallagan is a fortified traditional village in Ambarita that served as the seat of power for the Siallagan clan (marga). The village represents a complete pre-colonial Batak settlement, with defensive walls, traditional houses (rumah bolon), granaries (sopo), and the famous Stone Chairs judicial complex.

The Siallagan clan was one of the most powerful marga in the region, and their huta (village) was strategically positioned on elevated ground for defensive advantage. The village layout follows traditional Batak planning: entrance through a controlled gateway, central meeting area, chief's house facing east, and clan houses arranged in kinship order.

Huta Siallagan is famous for preserving the "complete set" of Batak village infrastructure. The stone chairs where justice was dispensed, the execution site, and the traditional houses form an intact historical complex now protected as cultural heritage.

The village name honors the Siallagan clan founder, and the surname "Siallagan" remains common among Batak Toba people. Descendants of the original clan still maintain the site.
