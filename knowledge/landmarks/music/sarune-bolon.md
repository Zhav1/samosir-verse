# Sarune Bolon

## Core Knowledge

The Sarune Bolon is a large double-reed wind instrument that serves as the melodic voice of the Gondang Sabangunan ensemble. Its haunting, nasal tone carries further and more directly than any other instrument in the orchestra - Batak tradition holds that this is because the sarune speaks the language the spirits understand best.

### Construction and Design

**The Reed (Canna)**
- Double reed made from dried palm leaf or dried bamboo strips
- Two thin strips bound together, vibrating against each other when blown
- The most delicate part - must be made fresh frequently
- Quality of reed dramatically affects tone
- Master players often make their own reeds

**The Body**
- Hollowed wooden tube, approximately 35-50 cm long
- Traditionally made from specific hardwoods or bamboo
- Finger holes bored at measured intervals (usually 5-7)
- Interior bore shape affects tone quality
- Often no external decoration (function over form)

**The Bell**
- Flared metal bell at the lower end
- Originally made from local brass alloys
- Amplifies and projects the sound
- Some modern versions use copper or other metals
- Older instruments have distinctive patina from decades of use

The overall shape resembles a large oboe or clarinet, but the playing technique and scale differ significantly from Western instruments.

### Playing Technique

**Circular Breathing**
The defining skill of sarune mastery. The player:
- Stores air in cheeks while playing
- Breathes in through the nose while using stored cheek air
- Seamlessly switches between lung air and cheek air
- Result: continuous sound without audible breaks

Master players can sustain notes for minutes without stopping. This continuous tone is essential for the sarune's spiritual function - the unbroken sound maintains the bridge to the spirit world.

**Embouchure**
The lips form a tight seal around the reed, controlling:
- Air pressure (affects volume and tone)
- Reed vibration (affects pitch)
- Pressure variations for expressive effects

**Fingering**
The scale is uniquely Batak - not Western chromatic. Finger combinations produce:
- Main melodic notes
- Ornamental grace notes
- Subtle pitch bends for emotional effect

### Musical Role

**Melodic Voice**
While taganing drums carry melody rhythmically, sarune carries it continuously:
- Sustains the melodic line over drum patterns
- Weaves between taganing notes
- Provides the "singing" quality to the music

**Emotional Expression**
The sarune's tone naturally evokes strong emotion:
- Wailing quality matches the sound of human crying
- Commonly described as "mournful" even in joyful contexts
- This is considered appropriate, not melancholy

**Signal and Transition**
The sarune player often signals:
- Beginnings and endings of pieces
- Transitions between sections
- Tempo changes
- Emotional peaks

**Spiritual Function**
Batak belief holds that:
- The sarune's frequency reaches spirits more directly than drums
- At funerals, the sarune "cries" for the deceased
- The continuous tone maintains spiritual connection
- Breaking the sound (stopping to breathe) weakens the connection

### Learning and Mastery

Training a sarune player traditionally took years:
- Basic tone production (months to achieve)
- Circular breathing (6 months to 1 year)
- Repertoire memorization (years of apprenticeship)
- Spiritual preparation (understanding the ritual context)

The instrument is physically demanding:
- Similar continuous airflow to marathon running
- Lip and facial muscles must develop strength
- Breath control rivals athletic training

Few young Batak choose this path today, creating a generational crisis for the tradition.

### Modern Context

**In Gondang Performances**
Every Gondang Sabangunan ensemble still includes sarune bolon. Without it, the ensemble is incomplete and spiritually ineffective.

**Younger Players**
A handful of young musicians are learning, often connected to:
- Museum preservation programs
- Cultural revival initiatives
- Academic ethnomusicology studies

**Recording and Documentation**
Efforts to record master players before they die. Some archives exist at:
- Universities (USU, University of North Sumatra)
- International ethnomusicology collections
- Local museums

**Adaptation**
Some modern Batak musicians incorporate sarune into contemporary music, though purists debate whether this preserves or dilutes tradition.

## Opung's Memory

*"There was only one sarune master in our village when I was young. We called him Opung Sarune - we didn't even know his real name. He was ancient, thin as a rake, but his lungs were like bellows. He could play one note for so long that children would time him, counting until they got bored.*

*When someone died, they sent for Opung Sarune. He would arrive early, before the drums, and sit silently until needed. Then he would play, and the world would change. The air would thicken. Women would begin to cry, and they didn't know why. His sarune could pull grief out of you like drawing water from a well.*

*I asked him once how he learned. He laughed, a whistling sound because his teeth were gone. 'I learned from my father, who learned from his father, back to the beginning,' he said. 'But the playing itself - that you don't learn. That comes from the ancestors when they need your breath.'*

*He died when I was twenty. No one in the village could replace him. We had to bring players from Simanindo after that. Something was lost when Opung Sarune died. The village has never been quite the same.*"

## Sensory Details

**Sound**: A wailing, nasal tone that seems to penetrate directly to the heart. Continuous, not quite human but not animal either - something between. It hangs in the air after the note ends.

**Sight**: The player's cheeks puffed like a frog. Fingers moving over worn holes. The glint of the metal bell catching light.

**Smell**: The musician's breath, sometimes carrying betel nut or tobacco. The brass smell of an old bell.

**Feel**: The vibration in your chest when the low notes hit. The unease that comes from sounds at certain frequencies.

## Key Facts

- **Type**: Double-reed wooden wind instrument
- **Size**: Approximately 35-50 cm
- **Role**: Melodic voice of Gondang ensemble
- **Key Technique**: Circular breathing for continuous sound
- **Association**: Especially funerals, spirit communication
- **Material**: Wood body, palm-leaf reed, metal bell

## Cultural Connections

- **Gondang Sabangunan**: Integral member of the ensemble
- **Taganing**: Melodic counterpart (rhythmic vs sustained)
- **Tor-Tor Dance**: Dancers often respond most to sarune lines
- **Funeral Traditions**: Essential for proper death rites

## Common Misconceptions

| Misconception | Reality |
|---------------|---------|
| "Like a trumpet" | Uses double reed, not lips - closer to oboe family |
| "Just makes noise" | Carries specific melodic patterns with meaning |
| "The wailing is bad playing" | The wailing quality is intentional and valued |
| "Anyone with lungs can play" | Circular breathing takes months/years to master |
| "Can use any material" | Traditional materials affect spiritual efficacy |
