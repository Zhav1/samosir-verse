# Sarune Bolon

## Core Knowledge
The Sarune Bolon is a large wooden trumpet with a distinctive double-reed mouthpiece, producing a haunting, nasal sound that carries for great distances. As part of the Gondang Sabangunan ensemble, it provides the melodic voice that weaves through the rhythmic drumming.

"Sarune" refers to the instrument and "Bolon" means "large" - distinguishing it from smaller Sarune variants. The instrument consists of a wooden body with a flared bell end, a tube section, and a double-reed (traditionally palm leaf) mouthpiece. Players use circular breathing to maintain continuous sound.

In Batak cosmology, the Sarune's sound is believed to reach the spirit world more directly than drums. Its wailing tone is particularly associated with funerals (ulaon mate), where it "cries" for the departed soul. The instrument's ability to sustain long notes symbolizes the bridge between the living and ancestors.

Mastering Sarune Bolon requires years of training, particularly the circular breathing technique that allows continuous play without pausing for breath. Master players can sustain notes for minutes, creating an almost supernatural sound.
