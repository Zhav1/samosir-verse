# Taganing

## Core Knowledge
The Taganing is a set of five tuned melodic drums that form the rhythmic and melodic heart of the Gondang Sabangunan ensemble. Unlike Western drums that only provide rhythm, Taganing drums are pitched - each drum produces a distinct note, allowing the player to create melodies.

The five drums are arranged in a curved row, suspended on a wooden frame. The drumheads, traditionally made from lizard skin, are tuned by adjusting rattan bindings. The player uses two wooden beaters to strike the drums in complex patterns, often at remarkable speed.

The lead Taganing player (partaganing) is the musical leader of any Gondang performance. They must memorize dozens of traditional compositions, each with specific ceremonial meaning. The partaganing signals tempo changes, starts and stops, and coordinates with the Sarune player.

The Batak tonal system differs from Western scales - the five drums don't correspond to do-re-mi but to a unique Batak pitch system. This is why recorded Gondang may sound "out of tune" to Western ears - it follows its own musical logic.
