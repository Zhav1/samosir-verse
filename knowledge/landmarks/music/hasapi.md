# Hasapi

## Core Knowledge
The Hasapi is a traditional two-stringed lute that serves as the intimate, personal counterpart to the grand Gondang ensemble. While Gondang is communal and ceremonial, Hasapi is individual and emotional - the instrument of storytellers, courtship, and personal lament.

Crafted from jackfruit wood (nangka), the Hasapi has a boat-shaped body and a long neck. The two strings, traditionally made from plant fiber but now often nylon, produce a melancholic, haunting tone. The musician plucks with the fingers while adjusting pitch with the fretting hand.

Hasapi is associated with "andung" - the Batak tradition of improvised mourning songs. When someone dies, a skilled Hasapi player might compose and perform songs recounting the deceased's life. This personal, emotional music making is distinct from the formal Gondang ceremonies.

Young Batak men historically learned Hasapi for courtship, serenading potential brides with songs declaring love and clan lineage. The instrument's soft tone allowed for intimate outdoor performances without disturbing the village.
