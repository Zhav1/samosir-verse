# Tor-Tor Dance

## Core Knowledge
Tor-Tor is the sacred ritual dance of the Batak Toba people, performed to the accompaniment of Gondang Sabangunan drums. The name comes from the sound of stamping feet on wooden floors of traditional houses. Far from mere entertainment, Tor-Tor is a form of spiritual embodiment - dancers become vessels for ancestral communication.

The dance is characterized by slow, deliberate movements: arms extended with palms facing down, fingers subtly moving, feet stepping in measured rhythm. The upper body remains relatively still while the lower body pulses to the Gondang beat. This restraint is deliberate - it represents humility before the ancestors.

Different Tor-Tor dances exist for different occasions:
- **Tor-Tor Somba** (worship dance): Performed at the start of ceremonies
- **Tor-Tor Sipitu Cawan** (seven bowls): Blessing dance
- **Tor-Tor Pangurason** (cleansing): Purification ritual
- **Tor-Tor Hasahatan** (joy): Celebration dance

In traditional context, not everyone could dance - participants were chosen based on kinship position and the specific ceremony. The Dalihan Na Tolu (three-pillar kinship) system determined who danced with whom.

## Key Facts
- Name origin: "Tor-tor" = stamping foot sound
- Accompaniment: Gondang Sabangunan mandatory
- Costume: Ulos (traditional cloth) draped ceremonially
- Posture: Arms extended, subtle hand movements
- Context: Never danced without music/ceremony

## Cultural Context
- Inseparable from Gondang - one cannot exist without other
- Dancers selected by kinship role (Dalihan Na Tolu)
- Receiving ulos during dance = highest honor
- Modern tourism shows are adapted versions
- UNESCO element of Intangible Cultural Heritage

## Common Misconceptions
- NOT casual folk dance - strictly ceremonial
- NOT choreographed performance - spiritual embodiment
- "Slow movements" are intentional, not lack of skill
- Cannot be properly danced to recorded music
